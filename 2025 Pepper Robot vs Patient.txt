Experiment # 1

Family Clinic - Examination Room between Robot and Patient

Robot: Good morning, Bajwa. What brings you in today?

Patient: Hi Doctor. I've had this persistent headache for about five days now.

Robot: I see. Can you describe the pain for me? Is it sharp or dull?

Patient: It's a constant dull ache, mostly around my temples. Sometimes it throbs.

Robot: Any nausea or sensitivity to light?

Patient: No nausea, but bright lights do make it worse.

Robot: How's your sleep been lately?

Patient: Not great actually. I've been stressed about work deadlines.

Robot: That could be contributing. Let me check your blood pressure first.
Your BP is slightly elevated - 135 over 85.

Patient: Is that serious?

Robot: Not dangerously high, but worth monitoring. I recommend:
1. Daily 20-minute walks
2. Limit screen time before bed
3. Try this headache diary [hands patient form]
4. Simple pain relievers when needed

Patient: Should I be worried about something serious?

Robot: Based on what you've described, this appears tension-related. But if you develop blurred vision, vomiting, or numbness, come back immediately.

Patient: Okay, that's reassuring. How long before I should see improvement?

Robot: Try these changes for 7-10 days. If no improvement, we'll consider further tests. Schedule a follow-up for next Friday?

Patient: Yes please. Thank you Doctor.

Robot: You're welcome. Take care of yourself, Bajwa.
